    <p> We are living in an age where tasks and systems are fusing together with the power of IOT to have a more efficient system of  
        working and to execute jobs quickly! With all the power at our finger tips this is what we have come up with.
    </p>

    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different systems,      
        while providing data for millions of people to use and capitalize. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system.
    </p>

    <p>One of the main concerns with our environment has been solid waste management which impacts the health and environment of our  
        society. The detection, monitoring and management of wastes is one of the primary problems of the present era. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present technologies.
    </p>

    <p>This is our solution, a method in which waste management is automated. This is our IoT Garbage Monitoring system, an innovative  
        way that will help to keep the cities clean and healthy.
